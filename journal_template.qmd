abstract: "Current and future health-related practitioners have low awareness of physical activity guidelines (PAGs) for general and clinical populations. The purpose of the present study was to critically appraise the quality of one 2021 draft training video, which was designed to help current and future health related practitioners give advice consistent with general adult PAGs. A descriptive qualitative analysis was performed on open-ended responses provided by undergraduate research assistants (or recent alumni) affiliated with the first author's lab and uninvolved in the video's creation. Participation was optional, anonymous, and through an online questionnaire, open for seven days in April 2023 (14 invited, 8 participated, response rate = 57.14%). Participant feedback was compared to applicable standards of the RE-AIM framework (i.e., reach, efficacy, and adoption). Face validity and other quality measures were determined through qualitative analysis. The first author performed the descriptive analysis, and the second author, acting as a critical friend, independently verified the trustworthiness of the analysis. No issues were identified (i.e., a succinct and verbatim analysis). Participants generally agreed the draft video was clear, concise, informative, and interesting. Participants did not perceive any major concerns with the video (e.g., non-offensive/biased), and their suggestions were used to finalize the training video (e.g., to add closed captioning, further explain a graph). Results confirmed the video had good face validity and could be effective within real-world educational settings for current and future health-related practitioners (e.g., low time burden, stimulating, informative). Future research should investigate learning outcomes of the video and its real-world implementation."

# Introduction

While current and future health-related practitioners should be better trained in using health behavior theory to counsel patients/clients and to plan services (Thomas & Cardinal, 2021), another looming issue concerns their ability to accurately and appropriately disseminate physical activity guidelines (PAGs, i.e., the frequency, intensity, duration, and type of activities recommended for health-related fitness and psychological well-being; U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, 2018; World Health Organization, 2020). Most health-related practitioners and college majors may lack PAG-awareness or precise knowledge of the guidelines (Cardinal et al., 2015; Vermeesch et al., 2020; Zenko & Ekkekakis, 2015). For example, Zenko and Ekkekakis (2015) used an 11-item multiple-choice test to assess practical knowledge of aerobic PAGs in a large and diverse sample of students and professionals. The mean score for the number of correct answers was 42.87% (95% CI = 42.08-43.65%). While job type and education level were significant predictors of test scores, the overall low scores suggest a need for improved training.

# Method

## Participants

Participants were undergraduate research assistants or recent alumni affiliated with the first author's lab and uninvolved in the video's creation. Participation was optional, anonymous, and through an online questionnaire, open for seven days in April 2023. Of the 14 individuals invited, 8 participated (response rate = 57.14%).

## Measures

The primary measure was a qualitative questionnaire designed to gather feedback on the draft training video. The questionnaire included open-ended questions about the clarity, informativeness, and potential effectiveness of the video. Responses were analyzed using a descriptive qualitative approach and compared to applicable standards of the RE-AIM framework (i.e., reach, efficacy, and adoption).

## Procedure

Participants were sent a link to view the draft training video and complete the online questionnaire. The first author performed the descriptive analysis of the responses, and the second author, acting as a critical friend, independently verified the trustworthiness of the analysis.

# Results

Participants generally agreed the draft video was clear, concise, informative, and interesting. No issues were identified in the analysis (i.e., a succinct and verbatim analysis). Participants did not perceive any major concerns with the video (e.g., non-offensive/biased), and their suggestions were used to finalize the training video (e.g., to add closed captioning, further explain a graph).

# Discussion

Results confirmed the video had good face validity and could be effective within real-world educational settings for current and future health-related practitioners (e.g., low time burden, stimulating, informative). The feedback provided valuable insights for finalizing the training video and ensuring its effectiveness in disseminating physical activity guidelines.

## Limitations and Future Directions

Limitations of this study include the small sample size and the fact that participants were affiliated with the first author's lab. Future research should investigate learning outcomes of the video and its real-world implementation with a larger and more diverse sample of health-related practitioners and students.

## Conclusion

The training video developed in this study shows promise as an effective tool for improving health-related practitioners' knowledge and dissemination of physical activity guidelines. By addressing the current gap in PAG awareness and knowledge, this video could contribute to better health outcomes for patients and clients.
